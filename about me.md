Hi, I’m Kelvin—an ambitious and resourceful Security Analyst who’s passionate about learning and mastering the art of cybersecurity. With a Bachelor's in Computer Security and Forensics, I’m on a mission to specialize in penetration testing, but I’m always open to learning across the entire cybersecurity field.

I’ve built my own homemade lab, where I practice everything from penetration testing techniques to web exploitation and vulnerability analysis. This hands-on environment gives me the freedom to experiment with tools like Nmap, Wireshark, and SIEM systems while continuously improving my knowledge and skills. It’s where theory meets practical application, and I thrive on pushing myself to explore deeper.

Some of my technical strengths include:

Operating Systems: Proficient in both Windows and Linux environments.
Risk Analysis & Vulnerability Scanning: Skilled in identifying risks and implementing proactive solutions.
Web Exploitation: Analyzing and testing web applications for vulnerabilities.
SIEM Systems: Hands-on experience with Cortex and other monitoring tools for detecting threats.
MITRE ATT&CK Framework: Knowledge of adversary tactics and techniques to improve defense strategies.
Python: Scripting and automation for penetration testing and task efficiency.
I’m all about continuous learning, and my lab allows me to explore, test, and enhance my skills in a safe environment. I’m driven by a desire to protect digital systems and make a meaningful impact in the cybersecurity space.

While I’m focused on penetration testing, I’m equally interested in exploring other cybersecurity roles where I can leverage my expertise and hands-on experience. If you’re looking for someone who is passionate, resourceful, and eager to tackle complex security challenges, I’d love to connect.
